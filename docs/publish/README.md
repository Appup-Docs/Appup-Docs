# Publish

In appup terms, publish means to expose the app from the customer`s cloud. We are one of the first in the industry to have a unified publish mechanism for, both, the frontend as well as the backend of a cloud app. And all this happens at the push of a button.
To rephrase this in business terms, you can add multiple use cases against the same frontend or backend and go to market with them almost immediately. In developer terms, our rapid application deployment platform follows the CI/CD model and has a very short mean time to resolution. You will spend more time adding features than debugging them. All this while lowering your costs and accessing latest innovations like AI, RPA and more. So, go ahead keep publishing! Do not stop checking on the marketplace while continuing to do so.
