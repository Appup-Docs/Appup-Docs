# CNAME
Each cloud you create is defined with a domain name provided under `<cloud-name>.appup.cloud`. You can choose to wrap this with a custom name representing your project or company. Simply copy the URL (without the `https://` part) in your cloud dashboard into your DNS configuration as a CNAME record.
