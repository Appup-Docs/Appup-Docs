Appup allows you to create state of the art interfaces quickly and without rework. You will learn how to use Frontend features to connect your workflows to your app's UI here. 

The main toolset we are going to use consists of **Pages**, **Blocks** and **Handlers**.

Let us look at the above briefly:

Pages: Any website usually is nothing but a collection of different pages that are connected to each other in different ways. Each of these pages is a HTML document that can be hosted on the internet and available through the browser.
Creating pages on appup is as simple as selecting a template for the page, adding the required predefined blocks in the page and making handlers to map business logic to specific elements of the page.

Blocks: 
  Blocks are individual self contained distinct elements of a page. A block is a component on the page that has a specific purpose to it. For instance header, footer, sidebar etc

Handlers: Appup allow you the capability to easily map the business logic to different elements across the page with handlers. Any action on the elements then is handled by it and an appropriate response is sent back to the requestor.

JS: <To be clarified and addedÃŸ>

CSS: Here, you can add the default styling for all apps of the cloud. Specific individual pages can always be styled differenly in their individual settings page.
