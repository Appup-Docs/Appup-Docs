# Handlers
Handlers are workflows for frontend. You use the same node based canvas to create frontend logic. The steps are now behaviors working your user's browser. Handlers are used to run business logic, make AJAX calls and preload forms or blocks.

## Preloading
Preloading means running a handler before a component is shown to the user. With preloading, you apply configuration you defined in your global JSON section into your components. Forms use preloading to configure what kind of inputs to show, what to do on submit and how to validate. Blocks use preloading to setup the behavior of their corresponding UI widget.
