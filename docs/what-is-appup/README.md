# What is Appup?

Have you ever run into any of the following scenarios:
* You need to make an enterprise app for your client quickly that’ll help them make a ton of money and give you a customer for life.
* You are using a commercial out of the box product but want to extend its functionality to accommodate your custom requirements.
* Development is slow and fraught with bugs. Lack of resources is hitting the top and bottom line.
* Business is running well and the company wants to start tracking & maximising revenues.
* You know the next million dollar idea but lack the resources or funds to make it a reality.

Appup is the solution for you ! 
It is an “Application as a Service” platform that is built up of two components:
1. A simple, robust & easy to use app builder having an in-built visual designer. This can be used across both, frontend as well as backend of an application. The backend interface allows you to intuitively organize business logic using tiny standalone lego like blocks of application functionality while the frontend interface helps create complimenting, minimalistic user interfaces already perfected over dozens of iterations. 
2. An apps marketplace that contains several AI, IoT and many other such innovative apps.You can also host your own apps in the appup marketplace. All these are offered on a pay per use model.
The distinguishing feature of the apps marketplace is the availability of a number of micro-apps & plugins that help you cater your custom requirements with little effort.  

The above two components of the platform go hand-in-hand with each other and revolutionise creation & usage of apps, not to mention the huge cost & value advantage that this brings to the end users. This is all made possible by the simple deployment process.
* Ease of Deployment:
Appup allows you to publish the app with all its dependencies to any cloud of your choice with a click of a button. The scaling and management of the apps is also completely automated, thereby saving you the overhead of hiring for new technologies outside of the purview of your business and additional operational expenses. All these savings are in addition to those that come as a result of the use of the visual designer. Lets understand more about the visual designer.

## Why Visual Designer:
The visual designer has a simple and flexible drag & drop interface. This interface is further enriched by a comprehensive set of nodes that offer varied and self contained blocks of varied business logic which helps you stitch together your requirements effortlessly.
It reduces your development time from days to hours and helps you cut down your development costs  as well. You can also easily compensate for the skills gaps in your team, across different stages of your product lifecycle, with our ready to use plugins. Integrate with everything, rapidly and easily.

## Why Appup?
Appup helps reduce the time to market of any app to one tenth of that of the industry standard and cut apps development & maintenance costs by a little over 50%. Appup offers the following benefits for you:

* Lower costs. Pay for the usage and not number of users
* Security
* Easy customization & integration
* Lower time to market
* Easy to use “Drag and Drop” interface
* Central governance

All the above factors together, we are able to provide a well rounded solution to our loyal customers. We count businesses, IT companies and independent developers among them.
## Build your own Apps
You will be spoilt for choice by the range of micro-apps available in our marketplace. If the app of your choice is not catering to your business requirements a 100%, just extend the available functionality or customise it to address your business needs. A popular choice for many customers is also to select multiple micro-apps & plugins and build their requirements on top of them.
To understand why, please see the below:

* Lower Risk. Secure
* Own data models
* Lean Development Cycle
* Easy to create powerful apps
* Proprietary process flows
* Make money of your apps

You can integrate the apps and plugins very easily using the Visual Designer with your business logic.

## How to Publish the Apps for use?
Appup combines containerisation of apps with a microservices architecture to deliver a secure “Build once, Deploy everywhere” platform. This enables the customers to create an app and publish it over appup or any other cloud of his choice. 
All apps created on appup are deployed and made available for use as immutable docker images. These docker images are stored on your cloud and managed by Kubernetes or other container management software. All your scaling and other app management needs are taken care of automatically. In addition to this, the apps created can be deployed and hosted on the marketplace as well, in just one click. 

The appup architecture allows the customer to take his app & its data with him, to any cloud he wants to. It is not binding on him to remain with any particular vendor.
You can easily move through different development cycles as well as phases in the product lifecycle, using the various easy deployment and provisioning options available.
