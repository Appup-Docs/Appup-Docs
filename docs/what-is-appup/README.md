# What is Appup?

Have you ever run into any of the following scenarios:
You need to make an enterprise app for your client quickly that’ll help them make a ton of money and give you a customer for life.
You are using a commercial out of the box product but want to extend its functionality to accommodate your custom requirements.
Development is slow and fraught with bugs. Lack of resources is hitting the top and bottom line.
Business is running well and the company wants to start tracking & maximising revenues.
You know the next million dollar idea but lack the resources or funds to make it a reality.

Appup is the solution for you ! 
It is an “Application as a Service” platform that is built up of three components:
1. A simple, robust & easy to use app builder having an in-built drag & drop interface. This can be used both across frontend as well as backend of an application.
Appup has a powerful & well-structured app frontend & backend builder. The ease of use of its in-built drag and drop designer helps incorporate any business logic in days if not hours.
2. An apps marketplace that contains several AI, IoT and many other latest innovations.
The distinguishing feature of the apps marketplace is the availability of a number of micro-apps & plugins on the marketplace.  All these are offered on a pay per use model.

The above two components of the platform go hand-in-hand with each other and revolutionise creation & usage of apps, not to mention the huge cost & value advantage that this brings to the end users.
## Why Appup?
Appup helps reduce the time to market of any app to one tenth of that of the industry standard and cut apps development & maintenance costs by a little over 50%. Appup offers the following value-adds:

* Easy to use “Drag and Drop” interface

## Why you should build your own Apps?
You will be spoilt for choice by the range of micro-apps available in our marketplace. If the app of your choice is not catering to your business requirements a 100%, just extend the available functionality or customise it to address your business needs. But the most popular choice for most customers, though, generally is to create their own apps from scratch.
To understand why, please see the below
* Own data models
* Proprietary process flows
* Easy to create powerful apps
* Secure
* Make money of your apps
* Lower Risk
* Verticalize popular apps
* Lean Development Cycle
* Secure and Powerful Visual Designer

You can also stitch together a bunch of apps to make your own business suite to cater to your requirements, using the Visual Designer.
## Why Visual Designer?
The visual designer has a simple and flexible drag & drop interface. You can use the backend interface to intuitively organize business logic using tiny standalone lego like blocks of application functionality. Use the frontend interface to create complimenting minimalistic user interfaces “Best by Default”.
It reduces your development time from days to hours and helps you cut down your development costs  as well. You can also easily compensate for the skills gaps in your team with our ready to use plugins.
## How to Publish the Apps for Worldwide use?
The apps created can be deployed and hosted on the marketplace in just one click. Appup combines containerisation of apps with a microservices architecture to deliver a secure “Build once, Deploy everywhere” platform. This enables the customers to create an app and publish it over appup or any other cloud of his choice. In other words he can take his app & its data with him wherever he wants and is not binded to keeping it on any third party server.
You can easily move through different development cycles as well as phases in the product lifecycle, using the easy deployment and provisioning options available.
